This web interface is designed to simulate touchscreen interactions on a Samsung Galaxy A11 device. It allows users to create tasks that consist of various blocks (tap, loop, print) and generate G-code to simulate these interactions. The interface includes a touchscreen simulator, a task log, and a live console output.
